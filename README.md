This is an app for people to set up reminders for their medications, diet, fitness, appointments and drinkage of water. The user can keep track of any appointment they donâ€™t want to forget, be reminded to take their drugs which i am sure people forget to take, keep track of the food they eat (carbohydrate, protein, etc), be reminded to take regular exercise to keep fit and of course most important of all take lots of water.

App Story:
The splash screen opens, which will lead us to the onboarding screen which gives the user the option to skip to homepage, sign up or login (which will also lead to the homepage). The homepage will give a summary of the users reminders. It will also have a notifications icon, an FAB (floating action button) for creating new reminders and a bottom navigation bar with three icons (one for the homepage, all reminders and users profile).When the FAB in the homepage is clicked, a pop up will display 5 different reminders to create, medications, water, fitness, appointments and diet. Each one leads to their own add reminder screen. In the all reminders screen, all the 5 reminders are displayed in different rows, showing only 3 reminders for each row and an option to see all for each. The see all option will lead to their respective all reminders screen  which will display complete and upcoming reminders which can be deleted if need be.
